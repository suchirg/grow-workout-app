# workout-app
An app to track your workouts.

### TODO
- [ ] fix pan gesture handler not working for updating weights & reps for a set
- [ ] Get sqlite database calls working instead of mock data
- [ ] implement user interactivity for the following things:
    - create, update, delete workout
    - create, update, delete exercise within workout
    - create, update, delete set within exercise within workout
- [ ] implement progress graph page to do 1rm calculations rather than just mocking the graph data
- [ ] remove unnecessary code (e.g. theme code all over the app, starter code that's not in use, etc.)
